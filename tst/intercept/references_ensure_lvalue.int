;; ERROR

foo : void (x : &int) { x = 42 };
;; `4`, an int literal, is an rvalue; meaning there is not an
;; address in memory where this is stored; it's simply a temporary
;; value.
;; An lvalue of type T is implicitly convertible to a reference of type
;; T, but an rvalue of type T is *not*. This means that the following
;; expression should error because `4`, an rvalue, can not be
;; implicitly converted into a reference of `int`.
foo(4);
