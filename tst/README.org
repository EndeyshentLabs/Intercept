* Algol End-to-End Testing Framework

** Running Tests

The ALGOL 68 Genie interpreter is required. Get it [[https://jmvdveer.home.xs4all.nl/en.download.algol-68-genie-current.html][here]].

Then, it's just a one-line shell command to run the test driver. Be sure to run it from the ~tst~ directory of the repository.

#+begin_src shell-script
  a68g main.a68
#+end_src

Any and all files within the ~tests~ subdirectory will automatically be treated as, you guessed it, tests.


** Writing New Tests

A test MUST have a declared expected return status of the program as the first line, following two bytes (comment starter). Like so.

#+begin_src un
  ; 16

  4 + 4 + 4 + 4
#+end_src

There MUST be an empty line between the beginning test expectation declaration and the following source code.

One can also set an expected stdout with following test expectation declaration lines.

#+begin_src
  ; 16
  ; E

  putchar : ext integer(c : integer)
  putchar(69)

  4 + 4 + 4 + 4
#+end_src
