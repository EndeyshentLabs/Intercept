;; While the Intercept compiler is smart enough to error during an
;; unhygienic expansion, it's much better to have it be nearly
;; impossible to occur. To accomplish this, we can tell the compiler
;; that we define a variable within the macro (along with it's name).
;; In fact, you can do that with as many names as you want. For each of
;; the names provided, the compiler will *rename* the use of that
;; identifier within the macro uniquely for each expansion of the macro.
