* Instead of Repetitive Type Boilerplate with Inheritance, Use Sum Types

Encoding meaning in the designation of a type itself vs within a larger encapsulating type. Best described by example.
#+begin_src c++-ts
class type {
  ...
};
class function_type : type {
  vector arguments;
  ...
};
class integer_type ...
#+end_src
You get the gist. This bloats immensely fast, exponentially, where adding a trivial type like an integer requires an entire class wrapping it.

In Glint, sum types let us represent these sort of structures. Do this instead.
#+begin_src glint-ts
type : sum {
  function :[argument];
  integer :int;
};
#+end_src
And I didn't even need to `...` anything, that's all of it. No enum required. Only as many type declarations as you actually need.
